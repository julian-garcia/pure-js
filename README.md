# Pure JavaScript
A collection of mini projects that were implemented using vanilla JavaScript (ES6). Other frameworks such as bootstrap, bootswatch, materializecss, skeleton and fontawesome are used purely for aesthetic purposes. Core functionality is developed in JavaScript only.

## Task List
Add/remove tasks to/from a todo list. Also store the list in local storage, continually adjusting it for additions and removals. Exact duplicates (case sensitive) are blocked at the point of user entry. A clear all option removes all tasks from the UI and from local storage. [Task List](#)

## Current Weather
Retrieve weather data from a weather API provided by [apixu.com](https://www.apixu.com) and render it to the DOM, storing the latest retrieved city in local storage so that it persists upon page refresh. [Weather](#)

## Profiles
Iterator in conjunction with a random user generator API [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me) to loop through ten random (fake) profiles and render details to the DOM. Upon looping through the ten profiles, a page reload is used to force another API to retrieve 10 more profiles. [Profiles](#)
