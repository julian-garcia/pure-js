A collection of mini projects that were implemented using vanilla JavaScript (ES6). Other frameworks such as bootstrap, materializecss, skeleton and fontawesome are used for aesthetic purposes. Core functionality is developed in JS only.

## Task List
Add/remove tasks to/from a todo list. Also store the list in local storage, continually adjusting it for additions and removals. Exact duplicates (case sensitive) are blocked at the point of user entry. A clear all option removes all tasks from the UI and from local storage. [Task List](#)
